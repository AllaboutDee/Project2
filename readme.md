DEE J PRO is a complex design made to emulate a real life dj. Due to its many functions and features this is not suitable to view on smaller screens. It can be viewed responsively on some ipads and is generally ok to view on laptop and desktop screens. 
In the near future I will design a more basic virtual DJ that will be suitable for smaller screens.

### **Planning stage:**
* In the planning stage, key elements were defined to shape the website’s structure, including user experience (UX) principles, aesthetic style, and interactive features. Each section was designed to enhance engagement and usability, focusing on mobile, ipad and laptop views.

### **Target Audiences:**
* Surfing enthusiasts of all levels
* Families seeking activities to enjoy together
* Individuals wanting to meet like-minded adventurers
* Community-oriented travelers and beach culture fans
* People eager to explore, learn, and connect within a supportive group
* Prospective new members who want to learn, participate, or get involved in future events and activities

### **User Stories:**

* As a user, I want to navigate easily across the site to find relevant information.
* As a user, I want to see upcoming events effortlessly.
* As a user, I want to quickly understand what the website is about.
* As a user, I want the site to look aesthetically pleasing across devices (mobile, tablet and laptop).
* As a user, I want my personal information to be secure.
* As a user, I want the site to be accessible on all my devices (mobile, ipad and laptop device).
* As a user and prospective member, I want a clear sign-up form to join.
* As a user and current member, I want up-to-date information on upcoming events and meetups.

### **Site Aims:**

* Informative: Provide users with easy access to activity or club details, schedules, and information about the club.
* Engaging: Use visual elements and a clear layout to attract and retain visitor attention.
* Community-focused: Promote connection among users through events, gallery images, and sign-up options.

### **How Will This Be Achieved:**

Each aim is reflected in the design choices, such as the use of high-quality images, event schedules, a gallery page, and a signup form. The site also has a clean layout, fast loading times, and accessibility considerations, ensuring a smooth experience.

* The **Home page** has a white background with vibrant colors and images reflecting surf and sea. The header and buttons are in blue/green tones, while reds and oranges in the cover text complement the visuals, tying it all together.
* The **Gallery section** showcases vibrant pictures of members surfing, relaxing, and partying, reinforcing the club’s close-knit, community vibe.
* The **Sign-up page** features a simple form for inquiries, membership sign-ups, and newsletter subscriptions.


### **Wireframes:**

Initially I drew a very basic draft of what the webpages may look like on mobile view: 

Drafts for the mobile view were sketched manually:  
![Mobile Drafts](assets/images/screenshots/draft_mobile_view.jpeg)


Finalized designs were displayed across various screen sizes using the Am I Responsive tool:

 ![Gallery](assets/images/screenshots/Am_I_Responsive_Gallery.jpg)
 ![Signup](assets/images/screenshots/Am_I_Responsive_signup.jpg)
    

### **Color Scheme:**

I selected a vibrant color scheme inspired by the sea, with blues and greens as primary colors and touches of red, orange, and yellow reflecting a sunset sky. A white background makes these colors stand out, while the header’s `#bdf2f6` color complements the hero image. The cover text container features an orange/coral tone to contrast the hero image and tie into the theme cohesively.
